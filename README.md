# illustrator-scripts
A set up of scripts I use for Illustrator for pre-press and print automation. My set up is Illustrator -> Direct Cut -> Allen Datagraph CentraHS

*squares3.jsx* adds .25" black squares to the corner of your artboard. I use it for registration marks on my die cutter.

*magenta.jsx* adds magenta lines in the top left top right and bottom left corners of the artboard. Again the lines are used for registration and cut during production.

*outline2.jsx* creates a dieline for the selected image. The dieline is 95% of the size of the image and shows up off-center. This one could use some work (centering - using bleed (-.125" cutlines) instead of a fixed %, if anyone wants to try. 

To use these files download, open Adobe Illustrator, Run Files-> Scripts -> Other Scripts and voila auto boxes and auto lines.

If you need any custom illustrator scripts for design, printing, die cutting feel free to reach out dan@midwestlabelsupply.com

# illustrator-scripts
A set up of scripts I use for Illustrator for pre-press and print automation. My set up is Illustrator -> Direct Cut -> Allen Datagraph CentraHS

*squares3.jsx* adds .25" black squares to the corner of your artboard. I use it for registration marks on my die cutter.

*magenta.jsx* adds magenta lines in the top left top right and bottom left corners of the artboard. Again the lines are used for registration and cut during production.

*outline2.jsx* creates a dieline for the selected image. The dieline is 95% of the size of the image and shows up off-center. This one could use some work (centering - using bleed in terms of auto-placing the bleed if anyone wants to try. 

*outline-.125inch-bleed.jsx* creates a dieline for the selected image with a .125 inch bleed on all sides but it shows up off-center. This one could use some work (centering) in terms of auto-placing the die cut line if anyone wants to try. 


To use these files download, open Adobe Illustrator, Run Files-> Scripts -> Other Scripts and voila auto boxes and auto lines.

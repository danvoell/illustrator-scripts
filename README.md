# illustrator-scripts
A set up of scripts I use for Illustrator for pre-press and print automation

squares3.jsx adds .25" black squares to the corner of your artboard. I use it for registration marks on my die cutter.

magenta.jsx adds magenta lines in the top left top right and bottom left corners. Again the lines are used for registration and cut during production.

To use these files download, open Adobe Illustrator, Run Files-> Scripts -> Other Scripts and voila auto boxes and auto lines.
